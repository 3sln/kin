  "kin: write a runtime's shared logic once, emit it for every host.

  ## Why this is code and not data

  The first version made per-target knowledge a table of format strings. It got
  most of the way and then leaked: FOUR things turned out not to be expressible
  as data, and each ended up special-cased in the translator instead --

  * Rust needs call arguments hoisted into temporaries and the others do not;
  * a loop test cannot be hoisted and has to be rewritten into the loop;
  * `mut` has to be inferred from whether the body assigns;
  * numeric width is a per-call cast.

  A translator that knows about all four is not a translator with a config
  file; it is a compiler for three languages wearing one. So the rules are
  FUNCTIONS. Each target implements each form, and the four become ordinary
  code inside the implementations that need them -- the Rust `invoke` hoists
  because Rust's `invoke` says so, and nothing else in the system knows.

  ## The pieces

  * `kin-ns` -- a VOCABULARY: tags, and per-target implementations of forms.
  * `kin` -- a DRIVER: targets, each with a path and a file preamble.
  * A source file is an ordinary `ns` with `:require`, so what a file may say is
    what it asked for. Two sources can use different vocabularies.

  ## Emission

  Two sinks, and the difference is the whole reason hoisting works:

      (kin-emit!  ctx \"...\")   append here
      (kin-before! ctx \"...\")   append BEFORE the current statement

  and `kin-render` runs a form into a string instead of the current sink, so
  an expression can be composed while a statement is emitted."

;; declaration wants the top of the FUNCTION, and neither is one level up.
