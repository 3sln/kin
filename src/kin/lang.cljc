  "The shape of a program, in three languages: `defn`, `let`, `if`, `return`.

  Split out of the codec's vocabulary once a SECOND source needed it. Nothing
  here knows what is being compiled -- a function signature, a local, a branch
  and a return are the same three-way disagreement whatever the body says, and
  a vocabulary that had to restate them per subject would make every new source
  pay for the language before it paid for its own subject.

  A vocabulary MERGES these in rather than inheriting them, so a subject that
  needs a different `let` can still have one. What it must not do is get them
  by accident, which is why this is a namespace a source has to name."

  because the argument is substituted into another template that does not
  re-parenthesise it, so the parens were carrying the precedence. An aesthetic
  rule silently changed the semantics, which is the one way the not-worse rule
  can do harm: correct always outranks tidy.

  "Does `tmpl` place `{i}` IMMEDIATELY inside a delimiter pair?

  This is the safe test for stripping an argument's outer parentheses, and it
  is a question about the TEMPLATE rather than about the expression -- which is
  what the earlier bug got wrong. `to-i32` is `((int) {0})`: the `{0}` sits
  after a cast, so its parens are load-bearing and stripping them produced
  `(int) n >>> 32`, which casts and then shifts. `wrapping_add({1})` puts the
  argument between `(` and `)` with nothing to bind to on either side, so its
  outer parens can only be noise.

  So the rule is not `strip when the expression looks fully parenthesised` --
  it is `strip only where the template guarantees there is nothing to bind
  with`. Same conclusion the hard way round: correct outranks tidy, and the way
  to be tidy safely is to prove there is nothing to break."

  `Table`, `Vec`, `Str`, `Bytes`, `Snap` and `Pike` are all loops over arrays.
  Nothing in phase 3 can be written without it.

  Rust says the range and infers the index type from it; the other two spell
  out all three clauses and need the type. The bound is evaluated ONCE in
  Rust's `start..end` and once per iteration in a C-style `for`, so a bound
  with a side effect would differ -- but a bound with a side effect in a loop
  header is not something any of the three hand-written runtimes does, and a

  it, which predate this file.

  THE TEST GOES INSIDE only when it has to. A loop test is evaluated every
  iteration, so a test needing a temporary cannot stay in the condition; but
  one that does not need a temporary can, and rewriting it anyway emits

      while true { if !c { break; } ... }

  The arms are VALUES, not statements, and that is forced rather than chosen.
  A Rust match arm is an expression, so writing `return X;` inside one emits
  `=> return CAT_MAP;,` -- which is what the first attempt did. The JVM and
  CLR need the opposite: a `case` label cannot yield a value, so each arm has
  to `return` for itself.

  So the source says the VALUE and each target spends what it must: Rust wraps
  the whole match in one `return`, the other two put a `return` in every arm.

  the first place it actually bites."
